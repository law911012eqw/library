# js_library
This project is a website tool that allows the users to maintain and organize the books they add purposely to keep track of books they have read or yet to read. Its main functionality is to add info about certain books, toggle whether the book had been read or not, and users may remove or edit the listed books anytime.

## Completion
This mini app is finished based on TOP instructions without the implementation of any optional features provided by TOP or myself. It is approximately completed at around 8-10 hours excluding the time gap during the procrastination mode. In terms of complexity, this project is currently in progress - working on firebase cloud database. Update: time spent -> 25% entire library 75% firebase authentication and database

## Roadmap
In the future, the user may choose its preference of how the books are viewed divided into two to three formats: table, grid and possibly bookshelf. The author is also pre-planning to code some sorting system on how the books are listed whether alphabetically by title, or author. There are some few aspects that are supposedly not to be mentioned at the moment due to the maintainer's dubiosity for capabilities. Cloud data are supported, so the users may remotely save their data in cloud by signing in an account such as Google.
